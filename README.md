# ðŸ¦• Dino Runner Game - Stage 1: Foundation & Setup

A comprehensive tutorial series for building a Dino Runner game using Deno and
TypeScript.

## Stage 1: Foundation & Setup

### Getting started

To run this project locally, you will need to install [Deno](https://deno.com/).

You can clone and deploy this project immediately to start building the Dino
Runner game.

[![Deploy on Deno](https://deno.com/button)](https://app.deno.com/new?clone=https://github.com/thisisjofrank/game-tutorial.git).

Once deployed, you can clone the created project to your local machine to work
on it.

## What's in this code?

This stage focuses on setting up a simple web server with some basic API
endpoints and static file serving.

### Project structure

```text

â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Server-side source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts             # Server entry point
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes/             # Route definitions
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ api.routes.ts   # API route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                 # Client-side static files

â”œâ”€â”€ deno.json               # Deno configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example            # Environment variables template
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Documentation
```

### `deno.json` - Project configuration

This is where we set up scripts and dependencies for our Deno project.

In this file you will see a `dev` task to run the development server and a
`serve` task to run the production server.

This is also where we define our dependencies in the `imports` section, such as
the Oak framework for building web servers.

### `src/main.ts` - HTTP Server entry point

This is where we set up our Deno server using the Oak framework with a
professional architecture. It handles static file serving from the `public/`
directory and provides organized API endpoints with proper separation of
concerns.

### `src/routes/api.routes.ts` - API route definitions

This file contains the API route definitions for our server. It currently
includes a simple health check endpoint that returns a JSON response to verify
that the server is running correctly.

### .env.example - Environment variables template

This file serves as a template for environment variables. Create a new file
called `.env` copy the contents of the example file to set up the server port
and other variables in future.

### `public/index.html` - A landing page

For now this page contains some simple HTML to demonstrate the server
functionality. This is where we will add a canvas in order to display the game
in later stages.

### `public/js/game.js` - Client-side game logic

This file will contain the logic for the game, for now it implements a simple
health check API endpoint.

### `public/css/styles.css` - Styles

Some simple CSS to make the landing page look clean and professional.

## Running the Code

To run the server, first install the dependencies, then start the server:

```bash
deno install
deno run dev
```

You can see the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Stage 1 Accomplishments

By completing Stage 1, you'll have:

- âœ… Set up a working Deno development environment
- âœ… Created a basic Oak web server
- âœ… Implemented static file serving
- âœ… Built a simple API endpoint
- âœ… Established project structure for future stages
